              "'data science enables businesses to process huge amounts of structured and unstructured big data to detect patterns. this in turn allows companies to increase efficiencies, manage costs, identify new market opportunities, and boost their market advantage.asking a personal assistant like alexa or siri for a recommendation demands data science. so does operating a selfdriving car, using a search engine that provides useful results, or talking to a chatbot for customer service. these are all reallife applications for data science.data science is the practice of mining large data sets of raw data, both structured and unstructured, to identify patterns and extract actionable insight from them. this is an interdisciplinary field, and the foundations of data science include statistics, inference, computer science, predictive analytics, machine learning algorithm development, and new technologies to gain insights from big data.to define data science and improve data science project management, start with its life cycle. the first stage in the data science pipeline workflow involves capture: acquiring data, sometimes extracting it, and entering it into the system. the next stage is maintenance, which includes data warehousing, data cleansing, data processing, data staging, and data architecture.data processing follows, and constitutes one of the data science fundamentals. it is during data exploration and processing that data scientists stand apart from data engineers. this stage involves data mining, data classification and clustering, data modeling, and summarizing insights gleaned from the datathe processes that create effective data.next comes data analysis, an equally critical stage. here, data scientists conduct exploratory and confirmatory work, regression, predictive analysis, qualitative analysis, and text mining. this stage is why there is no such thing as cookie cutter data sciencewhen it is done properly.during the final stage, the data scientist communicates insights. this involves data visualization, data reporting, the use of various business intelligence tools, and assisting businesses, policymakers, and others in smarter decision making.in the modeling step, data scientists fit the data into the model using machine learning algorithms. model selection depends on the type of data and the business requirement.data comes from various sources, such as online purchases, multimedia forms, instruments, financial logs, sensors, text files, and others. data might be unstructured, semistructured, or structured.unstructured data includes data from blogs, digital audiovideo feeds, digital images, emails, mobile devices, sensors, social networks and tweets, web pages, and online sources. semistructured data includes data from system log files, xml files, and text files. structured data which has already been processed in some way includes oltp, rdbms databases, transaction data, and other formats.this is all big data, and putting it to good use is a pressing job of the 21st century. its simply not possible to process tremendous amounts of data from disparate sources with simple business intelligence tools, or even data analytics tools. instead, data science presents businesses with advanced, complex algorithms and other tools for analyzing, cleansing, processing, and extracting meaningful insights from data.data science is not one tool, skill, or method. instead, it is a scientific approach that uses applied statistical and mathematical theory and computer tools to process big data.the foundations of data science combine the interdisciplinary strengths of data cleansing, intelligent data capture techniques, and data mining and programming. the result is the data scientist’s ability to capture, maintain, and prepare big data for intelligent analysis.this is one point that distinguishes the work of the data scientist from the data engineer, although sometimes the two roles are confused. the data engineer prepares data sets for the data scientist to work with and draw insights from, but the intelligent analysis work falls to data scientists, not data science engineers.big data is the raw material used in the field of data science. characterized by its velocity, variety, and volume the 3vs, big data is the raw material for data science, which affords the techniques for analyzing the data.data science is a broad, interdisciplinary area that blends applied business management, computer science, economics, mathematics, programming, and software engineering along with statistics. data science challenges require the collection, processing, management, analysis, and visualization of mass quantities of data, and data scientists use tools from various fields, including statistics, to achieve those goals.there is a close connection between data science and big data, and most big data exists in unstructured formats and includes some nonnumeric data. therefore, the task of processing data as a data scientist involves eliminating noise and extracting useful insights.these statistical tasks demand specific design and implementation in four data areas: acquisition, architecture, analysis, and archiving. these 4as of data science are unique to the field.statistics is its own broad field demanding subject matter expertise. it does cope with the study of numerical and categorical data, and statistics is an applied area that sees use in numerous other verticalsincluding data science.for example, statistical theory and methods allow data scientists to gather data in more powerful ways, analyze and interpret them for specific uses, and draw conclusions to solve particular problems. data scientists frequently employ statistical protocols as they design and conduct research to ensure their results are valid and consistent results.data mining is a technique used in business and data science both, while data science is an actual field of scientific study or discipline. data mining’s goal is to render data more usable for a specific business purpose. data science, in contrast, aims to create datadriven products and outcomesusually in a business context.data mining deals mostly with structured data, as exploring huge amounts of raw, unprocessed data is within the bounds of data science. however, data mining is part of what a data scientists might do, and its a skill that is part of the science.the phrase artificial intelligence or ai just means simulated human brain function in computers. the traits that signal this kind of brain function include learning, logical reasoning, and selfcorrection. in other words, when a machine can learn, correct itself as it learns, and reason and draw inferences on its own, it is an ai.artificial intelligence is either general or narrow. general ai refers to the types of intelligent computers we often see in movies. they can handle a wide range of activities almost like humans do, all of which demand reasoning, judgment, and thought. so far, this has not been achieved.however, narrow ai involves using the same kinds of thinking skills, but on very specific tasks. for example, ibms watson is an ai that can interpret certain kinds of medical records for diagnostic purposes as well or better than humans under the right conditions.scientists and engineers work to achieve artificial intelligence by creating artificial neural networks. but to teach machines to think like a human brain does, even for a very specific purpose, it takes an extraordinary amount of data. this is the intersection of data science, the field; artificial intelligence, the goal; and machine learning, the process.ai, data science and machine learning all work in tandem. machine learning is the field of data science that feeds computers huge amounts of data so they can learn to make insightful decisions similar to the way that humans do.for example, most humans learn as children what a flower is without thinking about it. however, the human brain achieves that learning through experienceby collecting dataon which specific features are associated with flowers.a machine can do the same thing with human help. as humans feed the machine massive quantities of data, it can learn that various petals, stems, and other features are all connected to flowers.in other words, humans feed training data or raw data to the machine, so it can learn all of the datas associated features. then, if the training was successful, testing with new data should reveal that the machine can distinguish the features it learned. if not, it needs more or better training.data science is a natural extension of statistics. it evolved alongside computer science to handle massive amounts of data with the help of new technologies.in contrast, machine learning is part of data science, but it is more of a process. machine learning allows computers to learnand do so more effectively over timewithout explicit programs for every bit of information.in machine learning, computers use algorithms to train themselves, but those algorithms rely on some source data. the machine uses that data as a training set, so it can improve its algorithm, tweaking and testing it, optimizing as it goes. it finetunes the various parameters of its data science algorithms this way using various statistical techniques, including naive bayes, regression, and supervised clustering.however, other techniques that require human input are also part of data science as we understand it today. for example, a machine can train another machine to detect data structures using unsupervised clustering to optimize a classification algorithm. but to completely finish the process, a human must still classify the structures the computer identifiesat least until it is fully trained.the scope of data science also goes far beyond machine learning, encompassing data that is generated not by any mechanical process, computer or machine. for example, data science also includes survey data, data from clinical trials, or really any other kind of data that existsthe full spectrum.data science also involves deploying data not just to train machines. far from being limited to statistical data issues, the field of data science certainly includes automating machine learning and datadriven decisions. however, it also encompasses data integration, data engineering, and data visualization, along with distributed architecture, and the creation of dashboards and other business intelligence tools. in fact, any deployment of data in production mode is also within the scope of data science.so, where a data scientists creates the insights they pull from data, a machine learns based on those insights that were already perceived by the data scientist. and while a machine may build its own insights on the existing algorithmic structure, the starting point relies on some kind of structured data.deep learning is a function of ai that mimics how the human brain works as it processes data and generates patterns to use as it makes decisions. deep learning is therefore a type of machine learning, focused on deep neural networks that can master unstructured or unlabeled data without human assistance. this is also called deep neural learning.deep learning uses hierarchical artificial neural networks to engage in the machine learning process. these artificial neural networks are like complex webs of neuron nodes, much like the human brain. although traditional data analysis programs approach data in a linear fashion, the deep learning systems hierarchy of function enables a nonlinear approach to problems.big data is typically unstructured, so deep learning is an important subset of data science research.statistical methods also ensure data scientists can thoroughly explore and describe data while fairly summarizing them. finally, statistical protocols are essential to accurate prediction and insightful inferences.next the model is tested to check its accuracy and other characteristics. this enables the data scientist to adjust the model to achieve the desired result. if the model is not quite right for the requirements, the team can select any of a range of different data science models.once proper testing with good data produces the desired results for the business intelligence requirement, the model can be finalized and deployed.by 2020, there will be around 40 zettabytes of datathats 40 trillion gigabytes. the amount of data that exists grows exponentially. at any time, about 90 percent of this huge amount of data gets generated in the most recent two years, according to sources like ibm and sintef.in fact, internet users generate about 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day. by 2020, every person on earth will be generating about 146,880 gb of data every day, and by 2025, that will be 165 zettabytes every year.this means there is a huge amount of work in data sciencemuch left to uncover. according to the guardian, in 2012 only about 0.5 percent of all data was analyzed.simple data analysis can interpret data from a single source, or a limited amount of data. however, data science tools are critical to understanding big data and data from multiple sources in a meaningful way. a look at some of the specific data science applications in business illustrate this point and provide a compelling introduction to data science.data science applications are frequently used in healthcare, marketing, banking and finance, and policy work. here are some common examples of data science services in action in trending data science fields:data science is transforming healthcare as consumers and healthcare providers alike use data that wearables generate to monitor and prevent health problems and emergencies. in 2018, mckinsey described a big data revolution in healthcare. in fact, according to mckinsey, applying data science to the us healthcare system could reduce healthcare spending by 300 billion to 450 billion, or 12 to 17 percent of its total cost.although the work of data scientists and data analysts are sometimes conflated, these fields are not the same. the term data science analyst really just means one or the other.a data scientist comes in earlier in the game than a data analyst, exploring a massive data set, investigating its potential, identifying trends and insights, and visualizing them for others. a data analyst sees data at a later stage. they report on what it tells them, make prescriptions for better performance based on their analysis, and optimize any data related tools.the data analyst is likely to be analyzing a specific dataset of structured or numerical data using a given question or questions. a data scientist is more likely to tackle larger masses of both structured and unstructured data. they will also formulate, test, and assess the performance of data questions in the context of an overall strategy.data analytics has more to do with placing historical data in context and less to do with predictive modeling and machine learning. data analysis is not an openminded search for the right question; it relies upon having the right questions in place from the start. furthermore, unlike data scientists, data analysts typically do not create statistical models or train machine learning tools.instead, data analysts focus on strategy for businesses, comparing data assets to various organizational hypotheses or plans. data analysts are also more likely to work with localized data that has already been processed. in contrast, both technical and nontechnical data science skills are essential to processing raw data as well as analyzing it. of course, both roles demand mathematical, analytical, and statistical skills.data analysts have less need for a broader business culture approach in their everyday work. instead, they tend to adopt a more measured, naileddown focus as they analyze pieces of data. their scope and purpose will almost certainly be more limited than those of a data scientist.'"
